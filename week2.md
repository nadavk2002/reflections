This simple data visualization is a line graph of the streaming service's monthly cost timeline from 2011 to the present. This visualization aims to portray the inflation and increase in the cost of the streaming industry. In a booming industry such as the streaming service industry, this visualization provides clarity to services that have drastically increased their prices in recent years. The colors used for each streaming company are well chosen, granted the services used in the visualization are the eight most popular on the market today. It is interesting how the designer chose for the layout to be on a dark background, and each color appears to glow or have a brighter saturation than the usual colors found in the color libraries I am familiar with. What seems even more difficult, however, is uploading the streaming service logo onto a certain coordinate in the plane and then surrounding the image with the same color its line represents. Given my current skillset, I don't know if I would be able to precisely round the corners of these images as well as round the corners of the lines when they are on a bend in the coordinate plane. This visualization was found on the dataIsBeautiful Reddit page at this user link: https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/19cz93q/oc_streaming_service_price_increases_since_2011/
While the visualization is simple and definitely more simple than last week's reflection, I did what I could to find a visualization that was closer to my skillset (while still a reach), a similar topic to my last reflection (movie-related), and one that is relevant to life today. There isn't anyone in my life who has not heard of or paid for at least one streaming service represented in the visualization I found, and the rise in cost is significant for many who may not have as much financial freedom as others.
